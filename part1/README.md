## Project Overview
HBnB allows users to create accounts, list properties, and make reservations. The project is divided into clear layers to separate concerns, making it modular and maintainable.

## Architecture
### Presentation Layer
- Handles user input and output
- Interacts with the business logic layer
- Exposes API endpoints or CLI commands
- Validates user requests

### Business Logic Layer
- Implements core functionalities such as user management, place listing, and reservations
- Enforces application rules and workflows
- Coordinates between presentation and persistence layers
- Handles data transformations

### Persistence Layer
- Stores and retrieves data from a database or file system
- Manages object serialization and deserialization
- Provides abstraction to isolate business logic from storage details
- Ensures data consistency and integrity
